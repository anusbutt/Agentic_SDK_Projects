# ✅ Task Agent – OpenAI Agents SDK Demo

A simple yet powerful **AI Task Manager Agent** built using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).  
This agent can **add**, **list**, and **clear tasks** using predefined tools — demonstrating how tool-based reasoning works in OpenAI’s agentic framework.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Task Agent** is designed to behave like a smart personal assistant that manages a user’s to-do list through natural language.  
It interprets your message and uses the right tools (`add_tasks`, `list_tasks`, or `clear_task`) to perform the action.
